# 📊 NumPy Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I’m learning and experimenting with **NumPy**, the fundamental Python library for numerical computing!  
This repo helps me document my progress, practice coding, and share useful examples.

## ✏️ About this repository

This repository includes:
- 📝 Step-by-step notes & explanations of core NumPy concepts
- ✅ Practice scripts and code snippets
- 🧪 Small experiments and mini-projects
- 📊 Examples covering arrays, indexing, slicing, broadcasting, aggregation, and more

The goal is to build a strong foundation in NumPy for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.
